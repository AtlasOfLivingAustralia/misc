I'll get Kristen to have a play now.\r\n\r\n Apr 19, 2012 Project Member #23 leebel...@gmail.com \r\nKristen (April 19): Summary \u2013 issues with running more than default number of site pairs, classification of transformed grids didn\u2019t work, additional outputs needed in zip file, HTML file needs a bit more work. \r\n\r\n1.\t\u201crecords per cell\u201d \u2013 this may be explained when we have the help files (when we write them) but intuitively \u201crecords\u201d to me means the number of species by locations within a grid cell (I\u2019m assuming this is a 1km grid cell). I think it would be more transparent to label this \u201ctaxa per cell\u201d (do we mean species? are these matched-species, is there an option to choose matched species? it is important to know what the taxonomic unit is for GDM). I\u2019m assuming the table represents the number of taxa per cell, rather than the number of records per cell. We had this conversation before and checked with Glenn. Even if Glenn uses the label \u201crecords per cell\u201d and assuming the data is actually \u201ctaxa per cell\u201d we should present the label as \u201ctaxa per cell\u201d. \r\n2.\t \u201cSelect a threshold to help generate the site pairs\u201d this should be changed to something like: \u201cSelect the minimum number of taxa in a single grid-cell representing an assemblage to include\u201d. The choice of threshold is designed to improve the quality of the data toward a \u201cpresence-absence\u201d sample by removing grid cell (sites) from consideration, not so much to help with generating the site-pairs, but does reduce the number of sites considered in generating site-pairs. I used a threshold of \u20188\u2019. \r\n3.\tThe bar for using all site pairs should also show the % site pairs (if easy to calculate on the fly)\r\n4.\tThe button for \u201cuse all site pairs\u201d \u2013 should say \u201cchoose the number of site pairs to use\u201d or \u201cuse default number of site pairs\u201d. I entered a number but it is not clear what would happen if I switched the button on or left it off. Are the button and bar interchangeable \u2013 one or the other, does one supersede the other? The default appears to be 1% (what was the rationale for the default?). The default should probably be set around 1 million site pairs or the number of available site pairs whichever is the lowest. For my random example the total site pairs is 4096000. The default is 40960. This wouldn\u2019t be a big enough sample to model, so I chose 1045070. My analysis is for Corymbia with the 5 standard predictors. I choose weight by number of species. \r\n5.\tProcessing: after a short time a message comes back saying the server is temporarily out of services, and stops the analysis although one has to physically close the window. Seems to say something about a bad gateway\u2026(is this a problem at my end related to my network and internet settings or software \u2013 I\u2019m using Google Chrome - or at the ALA server end?) \r\n6.\tI then had to start again. Perhaps the prelim analysis could be kept and become a set of assemblage points in then I could start again where I left off and try a different number of site pairs? This time I try 539391 site-pairs, and note that the bar is not present until I switch off the \u201cdefault\u201d\u2026 again the server out of service message came up\u2026 and the result below appeared\r\n7.\tGDM processing can take a while, it might be better if it went into the background on the server and returned the user to the ALA interface and then produced an email or pop-up when the processing is complete? \r\n8.\tThe user may undertake several iterations with GDM in order to find the best set of variables to include in the model. Typically, I iterate in using the fitting function of the model and when I\u2019m satisfied I produce the transformed grids. \r\n9.\tI try again, this time using the default number of site pairs\u2026.this time it worked\u2026and I have a look through the outputs, the transformed grid are also available for further analysis (or modelling)\r\n10.\tI now create a classification based on my transformed predictors using 20 groups\u2026but I received a failed message \u2013 in working through the steps of the classification, on the last page, the layer set is not listed? Is this an indicator of why the classification is not working with the transformed grids? I tried twice and the classification step failed each time\u2026\r\nHTTP Status 404 - /webportal//error/HTTP_NOT_FOUND.html.var\r\n\r\n Apr 19, 2012 #24 ajay.ranipeta \r\nKristen (April 19): Metadata info\r\n\r\nComments on HTML report:\r\n \r\nUnder \u201cyour options\u201d at the top of the HTML file need to include additional information about the parameters used in the analysis, please include:\r\n-          Assemblage: (e.g. Corymbia) (plus include the records for the assemblage in the download; add the assemblage to the map in the spatial portal) I was able to create my own download but have no idea what the taxonomic unit in the GDM analysis is.

If Ajay could start with a list, I could draft the commentary and Glenn could check this is right (see attached spreadsheet for starters).

This can be inferred from the gdm_params.txt\r\n\r\n May 27, 2012 Project Member #25 leebel...@gmail.com \r\nKristen: I think it would be worth making step 4 GDM Options that produces the summary of species available with an Analysis ID. If the analysis fails (which it almost always does for me because I pick too large an extent or too many site pairs), one has to go back to scratch. If the entries can be saved at Step 4, then one can make a small modification to the # site pairs and try again? Better still, run the GDM as a background job\u2026so that most analyses produce a result. \r\n\r\nLee: Ajay is currently working on background processing (#722).\r\n Status: Started Aug 21, 2012 Project Member #26 moyesyside \r\nLee - to my knowledge this is all done and in production.

The minimal data is author, image, date/time, latitude and longitude. ANY image uploaded to Panoramio IS available in the SP. There is no search ability in the SP but that would be a terrific idea, if it is possible. All that can be done currently is zoom/pan to area of interest and after clicking the 'Panoramio button' (under zoom slider), images will appear.\r\n\r\nIn principle, it would be a great idea to have a more systematic approach to site-based images. Mind you, there is nothing stopping anyone from uploading high-quality, systematic site images to Panoramio, e.g., TERN images!\r\n\r\n Cc: moyesyside chris.fl...@gmail.com Labels: -Priority-Low Priority-Medium\n"}], "date": "Thu Aug  8 05:39:34 2013"}, "hc1": {"author": "moyesyside", "comment": [{"text": "\n"}, {"i": {"text": "(No comment was entered for this change.)"}}, {"text": "\n"}], "date": "Thu Aug  8 16:28:40 2013", "updates": {"Labels": "SpatialPortal"}}, "hc2": {"author": "moyesyside", "comment": [{"text": "\n"}, {"i": {"text": "(No comment was entered for this change.)"}}, {"text": "\n"}], "date": "Sun Aug 11 16:55:55 2013", "updates": {"Labels": "-Priority-Medium Priority-Low"}}}}, {"AllLabels": "Priority-Low, Spatial-Portal, SpatialPortal, Type-Task", "ID": "75", "Modified": "Aug 09, 2013 05:27:29", "ModifiedTimestamp": "1376026049", "Owner": "leebel...@gmail.com", "Priority": "Low", "Status": "Started", "Summary": "Link layers entries to geonetwork metadata pages", "Type": "Task", "cc": ["chris.fl...@gmail.com"], "details": {"hc0": {"author": "moyesyside", "comment": [{"text": "\nOriginal Issue  - "}, {"a": {"link": "https://code.google.com/p/alageospatialportal/issues/detail?id=538", "text": "https://code.google.com/p/alageospatialportal/issues/detail?id=538"}}, {"text": "\r\n\r\n\r\nReported by gavin.ja...@gmail.com, Jun 1, 2011 \r\nUpdate the layers table so that entries link back to their respective geonetwork pages (where available).\r\n Jun 5, 2011 #1 gavin.ja...@gmail.com \r\nJust working out the kinks in dev now.

The only two layers that have been ingested using this process are Dynamic Land Cover and the new Land Cover Type layer that I got from AusCover.\r\n\r\nFor layers loaded via this process, a lot of data is read straight off files on disk where for other contextual layers it would be read from the layers database.\r\n\r\nBecause of this disk vs database difference, it is not possible to render gazetter areas for these layers in the ordinary way. So what Adam has done is display the entire layer that the layer belongs to, and then render it with a custom style to (in theory) only highlight the relevant area from the gazetter search. \r\n\r\nA problem with the generation of the custom style means that an incorrect area is highlighted.\r\n\r\nI can fix the problem with the custom style, however there are a few other problems here:\r\n\r\n1. The legend for the corresponding layer is displayed. e.g. the DLC legend is displayed when a gazetter search is done for \"open alpine\". This does not happen when a gazetteer area from other layers is displayed.\r\n\r\n2. The hover tool displays values for the corresponding layer, even in non-highlighted areas. This does not happen when a gazeteer area from other layers is displayed.\r\n\r\n3. The gazetteer area cannot be exported, used in an add to map/species etc. E.g. display \"open alpine\" and then try add to map/species.\r\n\r\nI can fix the aforementioned style problem to get areas to display correctly, but as you can see this is only part of the problem.\r\n\r\nThoughts Lee and Dave?\r\n\r\n Jun 5, 2013 Project Member #25 leebel...@gmail.com \r\nThanks Chris. I remember Adam telling me about this. We do need a mechanism for generating polygons based on a class of what I called a 'non-unique (polygon) contextual layer' (e.g., States and Territories, DLC etc. 'Unique polygon contextual layers' are for example LGAs (I presume) or drainage catchments.\r\n\r\nThe gazetteer in the SP is one of the most powerful tools, mainly due to the integration of a wide range of location information, not just the traditional Australian point gazetteer. \r\n\r\nThe power of 'Add to Map | Areas | Gazetteer polygon' is extreme. I suspect the biggest use will be for 'Tools | Area analysis' (and the Tools | Tabulation of course). This was the context of the request from Leo (and this will be a VERY common request!). Also, as you probably know, I'm EXTREMELY keen to beef up the Area Report. There are a number of easily added measures that would be great to see. This feature would be a game-changer.\r\n\r\nWe can certainly live with your 1 and 2 but the export bit of 3 is a pity (that we may have to live with). I've had about 10 requests for the ability to export the polygons from one class of a contextual map - mainly because this info is not available by other means.\r\n\r\n Jun 14, 2013 Project Member #26 chris.fl...@gmail.com \r\nI have fixed the display of the gazetteer areas for DLC and also the Auscover land type layer. Note that these areas still can't be used for export, add to map species etc.\r\n Jun 18, 2013 Project Member #27 leebel...@gmail.com \r\nNOPE: Problems remain.\r\n\r\nScenario-\r\n\r\n1.

That was the bug fix that I made.\r\n\r\nHowever the resulting \"area\" cannot be used in further operations. Export, add species to map, area report all will not work or will not work correctly. It appears that the support for contextual layers derived from large grids was not completed.

The points,  connected by shortest path form a time/location vector.\r\n\r\nA first step may be be an area-intersection with the points. For this, DwC records of each point observation would do. Ideally, we would want to determine an intersection of a track without points with an area.

Before the change there were 'Form' and source-based faceting at the top - specimen type, collector, institution and so on. I was very familiar with the list and could quickly find important headings.\r\n\r\nAfter the change, there is now taxonomic information at the top, and although this might make good logical sense, the order has changed and I no longer know my way around the list. This is probably how a newbie finds it - a bit confusing, and what does it all mean?\r\n\r\nAny wonder with 41 categories, each with up to 3 options each. Over 100 lines, all with good information needing to be thought about and assessed: Do I need this facet? Or is there another one?\r\n\r\nSo, I think a re-think is necessary. How should this large amount of helpful information be better presented?\r\n\r\nA few ideas, if only to kick this along... \r\n1. Use colour to split between what (taxonomy), who (source, institution, collector), where (location), when (dates), how (images, DNA), other\r\n\r\n2. Present a core subset of filter categories to open with. These could be modified using the customise list.\r\n\r\n3. Present a set of 6 facet categories, each open as drop-down lists.

Trailing zeros do really happen e.g. -35.4500 in a latitude. However, if latitude is served as a real number, of course the trailing zeros don\u2019t appear. A coordinatePrecision =0.0001 states that we REALLY, REALLY DO MEAN THAT WE WANT 4 DECIMALS!! However, the Atlas presumes to judge it\u2019s the precision which is wrong if the trailing zeros are missing. I submit that the validation rule is not logical: coordinates are real numbers; therefore the role of coordinatePrecision should be to mediate the coordinate value \u2013 i.e. specify the correct number of decimals including trailing zeros, as opposed to using the number of decimals in the coordinate (i.e. minus legitimate trailing zeros) to try to infer the validity of the precision value.

This would only search in the activities field.  This is probably what most people want information about.

The map widget needs to be streamlined and simplified.\r\n\r\nLastly, remove the top \"Submit a sighting button\", the one at the bottom is enough (we don't need 2 identical buttons on the page).\n"}], "date": "Tue Jun 24 18:19:12 2014"}}}, {"AllLabels": "Priority-Low, SpatialPortal, Type-Enhancement", "ID": "719", "Modified": "Aug 07, 2014 02:04:54", "ModifiedTimestamp": "1407377094", "Owner": "adam.col...@gmail.com", "Priority": "Low", "Status": "OnDev", "Summary": "Accept shapefiles in CRS other than WGS84", "Type": "Enhancement", "cc": ["moyesyside", "CoolDa...@gmail.com"], "details": {"hc0": {"author": "chris.go...@gmail.com", "comment": [{"text": "\nIt would be handy for MERIT in particular if the spatial portal could accept (via the upload function) shapefiles with a CRS other than WGS84.
